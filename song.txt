Amon Amarth We Shall Destroy

Sword and spear
Wall of shields
Standing strong
On this their chosen battlefield

Form the lines
Shield by shield
Side by side
We’re marching into destiny

March as one, don’t look back
Oden’s sons: attack!

Unleash hell, do not repent
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear

Hold the lines, move as one
In unity our victory’s won
Our shields will form a mighty wall
United we shall never fall


March as one, don’t look back
Oden’s sons: attack!

All are one and one is all
Side by side the battle calls
All are one and one is all
Shield by shield we’ll never fall

Unleash hell, do not repent
Warfare grants us no lament
Let your weapons slash and tear
This is no place for fear

Charge with force, break their ranks
No remorse, crush their flags
Pulverise the human wall
We shall destroy!
